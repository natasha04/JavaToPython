# JavaToPython
Here I'll introduce beginner programmers and developers to converting Java Code to Python Code. Python is one of the leading languages necessary in today's IT world. If you're a beginner at coding and know Java, I will show you how to convert java to python code and this will enable you to learn a new coding language simultaneously.

I choose to use NetBeans to run my Java code, you can use any online compiler or preferred IDE of your choice. 
I also use PyCharm and Anaconda for Python programming. Again, you can use any IDE of your choice for Python.

I will link a few useful tutorials here which you can use for downloading PyCharm and Anaconda. Please do note that I followed the tutorials while simultaneously downloading the software and I hope you'll do the same. Please don't just watch the tutorial and do it yourself afterwards because you may get confused and you may miss out on some important steps.
